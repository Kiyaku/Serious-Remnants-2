Ideas:
- figure out how to prevent random loot from skipping progression
- smaller chests? 
- custom end structures
  - or remove end altogether
- add cobble/mossy blocks to cave gen, maybe other stuff to make more interesting 
- add ores to only cave surfaces (see bookmarks for example)
- use modular machines + diversity to create big ember + bwm powered bores that generate specific items (TC gems/ores, AS ores, big amount of vanilla ores, etc)
- use Patchouli book to display custom drawings of ideas/machines the player discovers/comes up with
